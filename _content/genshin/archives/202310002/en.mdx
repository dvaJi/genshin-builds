## How to Use Geoculus

### Strengthening Your Statue of the Seven

Geoculus, much like Anemoculus in Mondstadt, is a collectible item found throughout the Liyue region. These treasures can be found in the wild and while exploring, and they play a vital role in leveling up the Statues of the Seven in Liyue, enhancing your stamina, and unlocking rewards.

Discover and collect all 130 Geoculus scattered across Liyue.

**The Mystery of Extra Geoculus**

Even after empowering the Statues of the Seven in Liyue, you may still have one unaccounted-for Geoculus in your inventory. Its purpose remains a mystery for now.

### Finding Missing Geoculus

Version 1.1 introduced a game-changing tool for Geoculus hunters.

### Unlocking the Geoculus Resonance Stone

To obtain the blueprint for the Geoculus Resonance Stone, you must achieve City Reputation Level 2 in Liyue.

### Crafting the Geoculus Resonance Stone

| Material      | Quantity |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Cor Lapis     | 5        |
| Glaze Lily    | 5        |
| Crystal Chunk | 1        |

Craft the Geoculus Resonance Stone using these essential materials. Cor Lapis and Glaze Lily are local specialty items unique to Liyue.

### Activating the Geoculus Resonance Stone

Once crafted, equip and use the item from your inventory. It will reveal an approximate location on your map where an undiscovered Geoculus awaits.

Note that Resonance Stone Gadgets are consumables; you will need to create another one after use.
